// Sequencing Ladder." Renders from the same `MEDICINES` dataset as
// /psychedelic-readiness-index (already ported to `lib/content/pri-data.ts`).
// Legacy's inline `styles` object is rebuilt as Tailwind classes. Real legacy
// bug fixed: Mambe's `complexityLevel` was "Gentle Entry" — not one of the six
// rungs — so legacy counted it in "All (39)" but never rendered its card;
// normalized to "Entry" in the dataset. The hero's hardcoded "38 medicines"
// now reads the real dataset count.

You don't go from smoking weed to finding God in an ayahuasca ceremony. You don't skip from kava to ibogaine. The ladder is not a suggestion — it is the accumulated wisdom of every tradition that has worked with these medicines for thousands of years.",
  "This is not a recommendation engine. We are not telling you what to take. We are showing you the natural sequence so you can understand where you are, where you might go next, and what you need to build before you get there.",
