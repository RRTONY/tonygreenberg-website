// (readiness levels, medicine match scoring, healing-sequence
// recommendations), unchanged. Extracted into a plain module so both the
// Server Component page and client islands can use it — same RSC-boundary
// lesson already applied to `kava-science.ts`. Legacy's `getSessionId()`
// (a `sessionStorage`-backed id used only to correlate `trpc` mutation
// calls with a backend this migration never built) is dropped entirely
// along with those calls — see the correction/referral forms, which use a
// `mailto:` fallback instead and need no session id.
