I am writing to ask your office to consider strong, transparent rules for commercial communications and personal-data privacy.

Clear sender identification, understandable opt-out choices, and meaningful privacy protections help people make informed decisions about the communications they receive.

I encourage your office to evaluate current law, regulator guidance, and constituent feedback when considering any future policy proposal.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]`;
