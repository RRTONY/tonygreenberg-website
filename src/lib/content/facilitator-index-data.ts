// proxies dropped per this repo's zero-Manus rule — see the page's port
// note in NEXTJS-MIGRATION-TODO.md).
//
// **Real content-drift bug found and resolved**: legacy shipped two
// divergent copies of the same "108 items" — the on-page JSX (rendered via
// `<Item>`/`<Trad>`) and a separate `printFacilitatorQuestions()` function
// that generated a print/PDF window from an entirely different, older set
// of item numbers, band groupings, and even a missing band (the on-page
// version's "Twenty-Five Traditions and Protocols" band doesn't exist at
// all in the print version). The print export was never updated when the
// on-page instrument was revised. This module uses the on-page version —
// the one actually shown to visitors — as the single authoritative source,
// so the ported page's print/PDF feature can never drift from what's
// displayed again.
