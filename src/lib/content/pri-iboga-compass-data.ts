export const COMPASS_VALIDITY_NOTICE =
  "This assessment uses weighted multi-dimensional scoring with hard filters across cardiac safety, family cardiac history, liver function, mental health, budget, geography, and dietary constraints. The math is real but the outputs are guidance, not medical clearance. Ibogaine has a narrow therapeutic window and 38 documented fatalities are in the literature — almost all from prior cardiac issues or unscreened QT prolongation. Always require an EKG (QTc measured), comprehensive metabolic panel (potassium, magnesium, calcium), liver function panel, and a written intake before booking. If you are on SSRIs, MAOIs, stimulants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or cardiac medications, those must be carefully tapered before treatment by a physician familiar with ibogaine pharmacology. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are absolute contraindications.";
