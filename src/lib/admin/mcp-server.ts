// Sent to every connecting client during the MCP handshake and meant to act
// like a system-prompt hint (per the MCP spec). The real rules live in one
// place, AGENTS.md on the default branch, served by get_project_rules - not
// duplicated here, so they can't drift. Some clients ignore these
// instructions, which is why the write tools are also hard-gated on
// rules_version (see project-rules.ts).
const ADMIN_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `This server lets you edit the tonygreenberg.com Next.js site's code and Sanity content.

STEP 1, EVERY CONVERSATION: call get_project_rules before anything else, read the rules it
returns in full (AGENTS.md first, then CONTRIBUTING.md), and follow them for the rest of the
conversation. They override your defaults. Every tool that changes the site or its content
requires the rulesVersion it returns as the rules_version argument, and refuses to run without it.

STEP 2, EVERY REQUEST: one request = one change. Call start_change, pass its change_id on
every edit, then submit_for_review with a plain summary, then list_pending_changes with that
change_id to show the review card. The person then publishes or discards THAT change only,
after you show what goes live and they confirm. list_change_history and undo_change restore
an earlier version.

The rules cover, among other things:
- Plain, short, jargon-free replies (Tony, Darryl and Kimberly aren't developers), no em dashes.
- Next.js 16 (params are Promises, proxy.ts not middleware.ts), Server Components by default.
- Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui only: no inline style={{}}, no framer-motion, next/image only.
- The content boundary: editorial copy/SEO/images in Sanity; quizzes, scoring and
  encyclopedia data in typed .ts modules in the repo.
- Zero Manus dependency: never add a Manus-hosted URL.
- Checks before calling anything done (check_code_quality on changed files, then
  check_pr_status and the Netlify preview link), and confirming with the person before
  publish_changes.
- Ending every reply that did work with the Status Report.

Background notes are in docs/ai/ (listed by get_project_rules). Read the relevant one with
github_read_file before changing that feature.`;

// One fresh Server per request (see api/mcp/route.ts) — cheap to construct,
// and keeps this stateless like everything else the admin tools touch.
// Commit messages on the admin branch carry who asked for the change, so
// git history shows which team member did what (every commit is otherwise
// authored by the one GitHub token).
