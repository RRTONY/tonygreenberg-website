            <p>This instrument does not ask what you have done.</p>
            <p>
              Not once. Not obliquely. Not in a free-text box where you might volunteer it. Every
              one of the 108 items below asks about belief, knowledge, judgment, or preference.
              There is no item anywhere in this document that asks you to describe your own conduct,
              name a participant, name a place, name a date, or confirm that any event occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is a design decision, not a courtesy. A survey of practitioners that asks about
              practice produces a document that is dangerous to the people who complete it honestly.
              The published research on this population says so directly. One recent study of
              psychedelic facilitators interpreted its own low response rate as evidence that only a
              small share of working practitioners felt safe answering questions about their
              personal experience, even anonymously, and observed that the field cannot understand
              how lived experience shapes competency if professionals do not feel safe discussing
              it.
            </p>
            <p>So we stopped asking.</p>
            <p>
              What follows measures judgment instead of activity. It turns out judgment is the
              better measurement anyway. What a practitioner believes should happen, what they
              consider a failure, how many people they think one human being can hold in a year, and
              how they assess a stranger&apos;s handling of a hard moment will tell you more about
              who they are than any inventory of what they did last spring.

            <p>
              A standard. There is no shared definition of adequate preparation, adequate
              integration, adequate screening, or adequate confidentiality in this field. Two
              hundred and fifty considered opinions is the beginning of one.
            </p>
            <p>
              A map. Practitioners see where they sit relative to a cohort they have never been able
              to see. Solemn or celebratory. Spirit or mechanism. Emergent or protocolized.
            </p>
            <p>
              A referral network. Facilitators who can see who thinks like them, and more usefully
              who does not, can refer with more precision than the current system, which is
              whispered names.
            </p>
            <p>
              A public record of contribution. Every improvement submitted through the Reciprocity
              Gate is logged, dated, and credited to a code. Contribution becomes ledger-able
              without exposure.
            </p>
            <p>
              That last one is the reason this exists at all. In most fields, reputation accrues to
              a name. Here, a name is a liability, so reputation has nowhere to go and the field
              cannot compound its own trust. Give the accrual a place to land that is not a name,
              and duration starts to mean something — time on a ledger rather than time in a rumor.

              On completion you are offered three opaque single-use tokens. Long random strings.
              There is no email field anywhere in this flow. We do not send anything. You copy the
              tokens and deliver them however you choose, to whomever you choose, or to nobody.
            </p>
            <p>
              We never learn who was contacted, how many were contacted, whether they were
              participants, or whether the tokens were used at all.

              A note on why a passphrase rather than a name. A name has low entropy, so a hash of a
              name can be guessed by anyone holding a list of candidate names. A passphrase you
              choose is far stronger and proves the same thing, which is that whoever is answering
              genuinely knows you. If you want name entry as well, the name is checked and discarded
              immediately, and the passphrase carries the actual security.

              Not verified. A practitioner could open three private windows and corroborate
              themselves in ninety seconds. There is no defense against that which does not require
              identity, and identity is precisely what this instrument refuses to collect. So the
              label is Corroborated, the limitation is printed beside it wherever it appears, and it
              is never presented as proof.
            </p>
            <p>
              Absence is never a negative. A practitioner working with people in genuinely sensitive
              circumstances should be contacting nobody. Corroboration displays as present or
              absent. It is never a score component and never sortable.
