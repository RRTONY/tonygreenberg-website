// the real facility-scoring engine (`pri-iboga-compass-engine.ts`, copied
// verbatim), and the real results view (matched facilities with real
// "why this matched" reasoning, real eliminated-facility reasons, real
// disclaimer), all ported unchanged and verbatim. Uses this site's
// `brand-gold`/`foreground`/`muted-foreground` tokens rather than the
// `pri-*` palette used by the rest of the PRI deep-dive modules — legacy's
// own hex here (`#8B6914`) is an exact match for `brand-gold`, i.e. this
// one page always used the main site's identity, not a PRI-specific one.
//
// Legacy's lead-capture gate posted to `trpc.assessments.submit` (no
// backend built for this migration) with a rich structured payload
// (question-by-question answers, top facility matches, primary goal,
// budget range). Replaced with a `mailto:` to Tony carrying the same
// structured summary — honest-degradation pattern used throughout this
// migration — rather than reproducing a submit call with nothing behind
// it. The "Submitting..." pending state and its error-toast path (both
// meaningless once there's no network call) are dropped along with it.
