              &ldquo;Here is what I want you to know before you go one click further. Most of these medicines I have never touched. Some of them I probably
              never will. What I have done is spent the better part of three decades watching this field from the inside... the researchers, the healers,
              the disasters, the quiet miracles that never made the news. This index is a synthesis of all of that. It exists because I have seen what
              happens when someone walks into a ceremony with no map and no container and no one who actually knows what they are doing. This is the map.
              Where you go from here is completely and entirely up to you.&rdquo;
